# Description

This repository is a meta platform for tracking work across all SDK teams:
- Mobile

Projects (and tracking issues for such) should always be created in this repository. Previously, those repositories have been used to track SDK work on a meta level:
- Mobile SDKs https://github.com/getsentry/team-mobile
- Web Platform SDKs https://github.com/getsentry/team-webplatform-meta
